## Day one: How I Accidentally Became My Own IT Department
It started innocently enough: a dusty, ex-lease desktop, a vague memory of someone on the internet
saying “Proxmox is awesome,” and a dangerous amount of curiosity.
Fast forward a year, and my home office looks like a low budget sci-fi movie.

### Enter Proxmox: The Rabbit Hole Beckons

When I first installed Proxmox VE on my newly-adopted hardware, I thought, “How hard could it be?”.
Within days, my evenings were spent spinning up LXC containers and 
VMs like a caffeinated DJ at a tech conference.

### From Hello World to Hello, World of Problems

Most of my adventures focused on software programming, setting up dev environments,
testing data pipelines, and trying to convince JupyterLab to play nicely with everything else. 
But soon, I was running media servers, exploring distributed databases, and wondering if I should
charge myself consulting fees.

Every time I broke something (which was often), I learned something new. 
Like how network bridges are not, in fact, magical unicorns that “just work.” 
Or that you can, in fact, crash your entire home network from a misconfigured DHCP server. 
(Sorry, everyone streaming Netflix in my house.)

### Lessons Learned (Or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Snapshots)

Proxmox’s snapshot feature quickly became my best friend. 
Every time I was about to try something new and potentially disastrous,
I’d take a deep breath, make a snapshot, and whisper, “You got this, buddy.” 
Sometimes I even meant myself.

I’ve spent hundreds of hours tinkering, breaking, fixing, and occasionally threatening
to replace everything with a Raspberry Pi. Through it all, Proxmox has been the unsung 
hero of my Data Science journey: enabling me to experiment rapidly, fail safely, 
and spin up new ideas faster than I can explain to my friends what a hypervisor actually is.

### Final Thoughts

If you’re thinking about building a home lab, do it.
You’ll learn more than you ever expected—about virtualization, 
networking, and the limits of your own patience. 
Plus, you’ll have great stories to tell, like the time you accidentally gave your fridge an IP address.

To everyone out there self-hosting their dreams (and their dev environments):
may your containers always start, your VMs never panic, and your family never notice the 2am reboots.
