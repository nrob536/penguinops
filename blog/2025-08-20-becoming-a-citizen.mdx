# Kaikōrero, response to the Mayor’s Welcome

Before the ceremony the organizers asked for a volunteer to say a few words 
in response to the Mayor's welcoming.
I did not hessitate to raise my hand for the task.
I came up with a short speech to speak on behalf
of all the new citizens attending the ceremony. 
Here, I'd rather share what becoming a citizen means to me.

# "Hei te tau tītoki", the year the tītoki tree blooms.

This whakataukī speaks of a moment long awaited, a season of renewal and promise.
For me, becoming a citizen of Aotearoa is that moment. It represents a time of growth, belonging,
and gratitude.

Although I have lived away from my birth country of Mexico for many years,
I carry my Mexican whakapapa with pride. My Latino roots shape who I am. 
they give me strength, colour, and resilience. Becoming a citizen of Aotearoa 
does not replace that identity; instead, it enriches it. It allows me to weave
the threads of my past with the new connections I have found here.

Aotearoa has welcomed me, not only with its natural beauty, but through its people,
culture, and values. Here, I have embraced te ao Māori, the spirit of whānau,
manaakitanga, and kotahitanga. Citizenship is more than a legal step.
it is a commitment to contribute, to protect, and to grow alongside the people of this land.

As the tītoki blooms, so too does my sense of identity. 
I am proud of where I come from, and proud now to call 
myself a citizen of Aotearoa New Zealand.
