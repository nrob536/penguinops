## Introduction
Discussions about societal progress often default to measuring productivity, growth, and economic metrics such as GDP.
However, these numbers only tell us a partial view of the whole picture.
Working on Ngā Tūtohu Aotearoa – Indicators Aotearoa New Zealand (IANZ) has reminded me that true
progress needs to include measurements of wellbeing.

IANZ was designed to go beyond traditional measures, offering a holistic,
data-driven picture of life in Aotearoa New Zealand. 
From my experience contributing to this project, I've seen how data can help translate complex ideas of wellbeing
into actionable insight

## What Is Ngā Tūtohu Aotearoa?

Ngā Tūtohu Aotearoa is a national wellbeing framework that provides indicators across social, environmental,
and economic dimensions. It reflects the idea that prosperity isn’t just about income or output.
It is also about people’s capacity to live meaningful, healthy, and connected lives.

At its core, the initiative seeks to:

* Measure what matters most to people and communities
* Track wellbeing outcomes over time and across groups
* Support evidence-informed policy that promotes long-term sustainability
* Reflect Te Ao Māori perspectives, acknowledging wellbeing as relational and interdependent

The result is a living framework of indicators, from air quality and biodiversity to income inequality and sense of belonging.
This framework can be used by decision-makers to understand the broader impacts of policy choices.

## My Role and Reflections

As part of the team supporting the IANZ platform, my work has focused on data integration, dashboard development, 
and analytical consistency. I have helped to bridge data gaps, design ways to visualise 
and communicate complex relationships between wellbeing indicators.

Working across these data systems has revealed how interconnected wellbeing truly is.
Improvements in environmental indicators, for instance, often correlated with gains in community cohesion or mental health.
Conversely, economic stress could ripple through domains as diverse as education and biodiversity.

Through this experience, I came to see IANZ not simply as a data project, but as a social investment in understanding ourselves.
A national effort to measure the conditions that enable people and communities to thrive.

## From Data to Insight

Transforming wellbeing data into meaningful insight has required both technical and conceptual innovation.
Three lessons stood out to me:

### 1. Context Matters

Indicators gain meaning when grounded in the lived experience of people and places.
A rise in employment rates, for example, doesn’t automatically translate to better wellbeing 
if job quality or community cohesion declines. 
Understanding these nuances required cross-domain collaboration and careful interpretation.

### 2. Accessibility Drives Impact

Wellbeing data must be not only accurate but also accessible. Designing dashboards and visual tools that made indicators
easy to explore helped expand their reach. This enable researchers, journalists, and communities to engage with the data directly.

### 3. Consistency Enables Trust

With dozens of indicators drawn from varied sources, ensuring methodological consistency and transparency was critical.
Reliable metadata, version control, and reproducible workflows turned what could have been an abstract collection of numbers
into a trustworthy resource for evidence-based policy.

## Te Ao Māori and Wellbeing

One of the most distinctive aspects of Ngā Tūtohu Aotearoa is its integration of Te Ao Māori perspectives on wellbeing.
Rather than treating wellbeing as an individual condition, Māori frameworks such as He Ara Waiora view it as collective,
relational, and holistic.

From my perspective, this enriched the analytical process in two important ways:

It encouraged us to think in systems, understanding wellbeing as a web of interconnected outcomes.

It grounded the work in values such as manaakitanga (care), whanaungatanga (relationships), and kaitiakitanga (guardianship).

These principles deepened the meaning of “indicators,” reminding us that data isn’t just technical — it’s cultural. 
Measuring wellbeing, in this sense, is also an act of stewardship.

## Conclusion
Working on this project reminded me that as data scientists, we play a role not just in managing information, 
but in shaping the stories that data tells.
When those stories reflect the full diversity of our society, its people, land, and values,
they become powerful tools for collective progress.
